INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE EVALUATORS
-------------------------------

My solution is provided in a class named MultithreadedCountyResolver.

To speed up the processing, the following strategies were implemented:

- All the county polygons were read and cached into a Map.
- All points were processed in batches of configurable size.
- Batches are processed in a thread pool of configurable size.
- Each batch is processed in a separate thread.
- Once the work is finished, thread pool is smoothly shutdown.

Test routines were implemented separeately:
- Provided class ResolverTest was modified to use the developed solution using locations-small.csv
- Another performance class similar to ResolverTest was created to run the implemented solution with locations.csv
- A Unite test to demonstrate the precision of the provided solution was implemented.

The execution time was substantially reduced. Since the performance parameter is the execution time, when the implemented
solution is run in an acceptable fast processor, it works well. However, the performance is affected when run in a slow machine
or a machine with considerable load. These two fators (machine speed and load) are not considered in the time criteria.
